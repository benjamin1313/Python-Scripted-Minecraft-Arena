# Python Scripted Minecraft Arena

i have made a python script for Minecraft to control an arena. 
i have some of the basics done and still have a lot more complex stuff i would like to add.

the script talks to the server using the raspberryJuice plugin.
which can be found here: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/raspberryjuice/

right now you can only place and remove some simple blocks and traps plus creating/rebuilding the arena.

todos:
  add so you can see which item you are currently using.
  add different sizes to the traps.
  add more complex traps.
  find a better way to check how the arena look like.
